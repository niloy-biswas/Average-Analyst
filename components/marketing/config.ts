    id: "self-host",
    question: "Can Evid be self-hosted?",

      "The app is designed to be self-hostable and avoids Vercel-only APIs. Docker and Docker Compose packaging are roadmap items. The intended first path is Supabase Cloud plus a containerized app.",

    id: "bi-replace",
    question: "Does this replace our BI tool?",

      "No. Evid works beside Metabase, Looker Studio, Looker, Power BI, or other BI tools. It governs the AI layer around published context. It does not need to replace your charts.",
  },
  {
    id: "vs-generic",
    question: "How is this different from a generic AI SQL tool?",
    answer:
      "Questions are scoped to a published dashboard, grounded in business rules and caveats, limited to approved tables, and gated by role-based publishing. Every answer comes back with the SQL, the source tables, and the context that shaped it, so you can check the work.",
  },
  {
    id: "byo-model",
